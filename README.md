🎮 **About Me**

I'm a developer with a love for games and creative coding. Every day is a new opportunity to learn, whether I'm working on a new parser, a file format converter, or supporting my university's web projects in the frontend area. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me sketching, designing in Figma, or organizing ideas with Kanban boards and collaborative tools.
